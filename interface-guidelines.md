## Interface Guidelines

Games can use the OUYA controller buttons however they wish, but we recommend the mappings below for the **O**, **U**, **Y**, and **A** buttons. If you are running a stock Android application that is not OUYA-aware, this is also how the buttons will be mapped to the standard Android navigation buttons on the navigation bar for a typical device.
```text
OUYA    Color    Default Function
----    -----    ----------------
O       green    select
U       blue     options (Android's menu function)
Y       yellow   -
A       red      back/cancel
```

Please use the naming conventions below when referring to the controller buttons in help screens for your game:
```text
O - the bottom primary action button, blue
U - the left primary action button, green
Y - the top primary action button, yellow
A - the right primary action button, red
System - the "home" button
D-Pad - the 8-way digital directional pad
LS - the left joystick 
L1 - the upper left bumper
L2 - the bottom left trigger
L3 - the button function of "clicking in" the left joystick
RS - the right joystick 
R1 - the upper right bumper
R2 - the bottom right trigger
R3 - the button function of "clicking in" the right joystick
Touchpad - the tactile sensor pointing surface. Not "Trackpad"
```

You may also incorporate the following button icons into your game's help screens if you wish.
